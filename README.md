# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The primary objective is to clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies, and then perform an exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [Name of Dataset, e.g., "the Titanic Dataset"]. It contains various features related to [brief description of what the dataset contains, e.g., "passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, class, and whether they survived the disaster"].

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Addressing outliers.
   - Correcting data types.
   - Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary statistics.
   - Data visualization (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatter plots).
   - Exploring relationships between variables.
   - Identifying patterns and trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
